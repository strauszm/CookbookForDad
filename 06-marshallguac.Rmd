# Marshall family guacamole {#guac .unnumbered}

*The Marshalls, going back to Elibet, know how to make guacamole. Here is my version of their recipe.*

**Ingredients:**  
1 clove garlic  
1 lemon or lime  
3-4 avocados  
salt  
cumin  
a bit of green salsa  
hot sauce or powdered dried chilies

**Steps**
1. Mince garlic, and cover with lemon or lime. Let it pickle for about 15 minutes.  
2. Cut avocados and put their inside with the garlic and lime. Add a bit of salt, a bit of cumin, a tablespoon or so of green salsa, and a bit of hot sauce or dried chilies.  
3. Mash with a fork, being sure to preserve some chunks (you don;t want it to be fully blended).
