"],["Strausz-pasta.html", "Strausz pasta", " Strausz pasta I have been making this for many years, ever since an Italian friend of Kate and me taught me how to make a version. I adapted it a bit based on a pasta that my old friend Jon Knoll taught me to make. I called the pasta that Jon made “Knoll Pasta,” so I call this Strausz Pasta. Ingredients: 1 oz dried porcine or other flavorful mushrooms (I have used shiitake too) 8-10 cloves of garlic (not frozen or powdered), minced 1/3 c extra virgin olive oil (plus more for sauteing mushrooms and onions) 1 lb mushrooms (any kind), chopped 1 onion, chopped 1 pound pasta Steps: Cover dried mushrooms in water, and leave them on low heat for at least 15 minutes; more is fine. Combine garlic with olive oil, a bit of salt and pepper. Simmer over medium-low until the garlic just starts to color. This may take a long time – at least 15 minutes. Once dried mushrooms are done, drain them in a colander lined with paper towel. Cut mushrooms, and saute in more olive oil over medium in a large pan with fresh mushrooms and onions. Saute until they have a good deal of color on them. Cook pasta in salted water. Reserve about 1/3 cup of the cooking liquid. Combine olive oil, garlic, mushrooms, onions, 1/3 cup mushroom water, and 1/3 cup pasta cooking water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a bit of salt to the rest of the mushroom water and keep it as a veggie broth for other uses. "],["salmon-in-wine-reduction.html", "Salmon in wine reduction", " Salmon in wine reduction This is a very easy dish to make, but it doesn’t taste like it. I based it on instructions from Serious Eats, one of my favorite cooking sites. I often cook it with with rice and a vegetable, and then I use some of the leftover rice to make fried rice. Ingredients: Between 1 and 2 lbs salmon fillets 3 cloves garlic, minced (fresh is always better, but it is less important here than with Strausz pasta) 1/2 cup red wine (the recipe will also work with white wine) 1 cup broth (I often use the leftover mushroom water from Strausz pasta 1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces Steps: Heat a large cast iron skillet to medium for a while (5-10 minutes) Add some olive oil to the pan put salmon fillets, flesh side down, on the skillet for 5 minutes. Turn, and cook for 5 minutes on the other side, and check inside of fish for doneness. If it is not done, cook for another minute and try again. Remove salmon from oven and put on a plate. You can put another plate on top, upside down, to keep it warm. Add a bit of olive oil to pan, and scrape the pan with a spatula to get the “fond” from the fish. This will make the sauce yummier. Add the garlic to the pan along with a bit of salt, and stir for about about 15 seconds. Add wine and reduce to what the French call au sec (almost dry). You should be able to scrape a spatula through it and leave a trail. Add broth and scatter butter throughout the sauce. Whisk until the sauce looks creamy, thick, and opaque. Taste for seasoning, and add salt and pepper if necessary. Pour sauce in a bowl, sprinkle some over the fillets, and serve with the rest of the sauce. Instead of or in addition to garlic, you can use shallots, cumin, paprika, and/or other aromatics when you add the garlic. "],["fried-rice.html", "Fried rice", " Fried rice This is my version of the Mark Bittman’s recipe from How to Cook Everything. It is one of the dishes that I have been making the longest, and it is one of Kate’s favorites. Fried rice is often said to be better with leftover rice. These are instructions for a cast iron skillet because I don’t think you have a wok, but if you get one let me know and I will update the recipe! The eggs give it some nice protein, but you can also add tofu or other cooked meat if you want. You can include any diced vegetables. If you want to add some spinach, you can add it at the same time you add the eggs. Ingredients: vegetable oil Around 3 cups leftover rice (can be brown or white) 1 onion or green onions, diced 1 carrot, diced 3 stalks celery, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 eggs, beaten 2 Tablespoons soy sauce (you can use some hoisin sauce, vegan oyster sauce, or other sauces that appeal to you instead or in addition) Sesame seeds (optional) Steps: Heat a large cast iron skillet to medium for a while (5-10 minutes) Add some vegetable oil, and then add the rice, and spread out in the pan. Leave it stirred for 1-2 minutes, and then stir/turn the rice. Repeat until the rice has a nice texture Add the carrots, onions, celery, and other vegetables, and stir for a few minutes, until they are cooked. Make a well in the center of the rice. Add a bit more oil, and then the garlic. Let the garlic sizzle for about 15 seconds. Add eggs to the well, and start to stir. Gradually incorporate rice into egg scramble. Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce and sesame seeds. "],["matza-ball.html", "Matza ball soup", " Matza ball soup “We wasted that group like matza ball soup” -The Making of Rafi Schwartz, the Ultimate Kung Fu Jew This is a version of the soup that I made for Passover a few years ago. Ingredients: 1 oz dried mushrooms (shiitakes or porchini work well, but anything will do) Olive oil 1 sweet potato, diced 1 onion, diced 3 pieces celery, diced 1 lb mushrooms, sliced about 1 cm thick 1 carrot, diced 1 sweet potato, diced 1 package of matza balls (you can also make them from scratch; I like the recipe associated with this soup) Steps: 1. Boil water, and pour over the dried mushrooms. Let the mushrooms reconstitute for at least 15 minutes (longer is ok). 2. Drain mushrooms into a metal colander lined with paper towel, and save the liquid (that will be your broth). Salt the mushroom water. 3. Heat oil in a big pot over medium. Once it is hot, add all your vegetables (including teh mushrooms that had been dried before. Cook for about 10 minutes. 4. Add between 8 - 12 cups of liquid total (the salted mushroom water + regular water to bring you to 8 - 12 cups). Season with salt and paper. 5. Bring to a boil and then turn heat down. 6. Cook the matza balls in the soup following package directions or the directions from the recipe you are using. Serve as soon as the matza balls are ready. Don’t simmer endlessly or the vegetables will get mushy. "],["tahdig.html", "Herbed rice with tahdig", " Herbed rice with tahdig This is a slight modification of Samin Nosrat’s amazing recipe from the New York Times. She recommends a 10-inch cast iron pan, and I have made adjustments for a 12-inch pan. Ingredients: 2 cups basmati rice 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 cups finely diced leeks, including the dark green parts (2 medium leeks or 1 very large leek) salt 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 cup finely chopped dill leaves and tender stems (about 2 bunches) 1 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems (about 2 large bunches) 3 tablespoons Greek yogurt 3 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as canola Steps: 1. Place rice in a bowl and rinse with cold water. Swirl vigorously with your fingers to release the starch, and change the water at least five times, until it runs clear. Once the water runs clear, let rice soak for 30 minutes. 2. Fill a large stockpot with 4 quarts of water (16 cups). Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. 3. Set a very well-seasoned 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons butter. When butter melts, add leeks and a pinch of salt. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. 4. Once water comes to a boil, season it very heavily with either 6 tablespoons fine sea salt or a generous ½ cup kosher salt and the ground turmeric. (Don’t worry about oversalting; the rice will spend only a few minutes in this water.) Drain rice, then add it to the pot and stir. Set a fine-mesh sieve or colander in the sink. Cook rice, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain into the sieve, then rinse with cold water to keep rice from cooking further. Drain rice well and place in a large bowl. 5. Add leeks, dill and cilantro to rice. Stir well to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if needed. Remove 1 heaping cup of the rice mixture to a small bowl and mix with yogurt. 6. Rinse and dry the skillet and return it to medium heat. Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter and the oil. When butter melts, add rice-yogurt mixture and spread it out into a thin, even layer with a heatproof spatula. 7. Pile remaining rice into the pan, mounding it gently toward the center. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, gently dig 6 holes into the rice down to the bottom of the pot, which will be barely sizzling. Dig 5 of the holes about 2 inches from the sides of the pan, and put one in the center. (The holes will allow steam to escape from the bottommost layer of rice and allow a crisp crust to form.) There should be enough oil in the pan that you can see it bubbling up the sides; add a little more oil along the edges of the rice if needed to see these bubbles. 8. Continue cooking rice over medium-high heat for 8 minutes, or until evenly browned along the edges, rotating the pan a half turn after 4 minutes to ensure even browning. Wrap a lid with a kitchen towel and cover pan. Turn the heat as low as it will go and continue cooking another 45 minutes, rotating the pan a quarter turn every 10 to 12 minutes. The rice is done when it’s cooked completely through. 9. To unmold the rice, carefully run an offset spatula or butter knife along the edges of the pan to ensure that no part of the crust is sticking. Tip out any excess fat at the bottom of the pan into a bowl, gather your courage, and then carefully flip it onto a platter or cutting board. Serve immediately.
